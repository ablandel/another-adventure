# Another Adventure ‚õêìÇÉ ‡ΩºìÇÉ·®í‚Üüñ†∞

Simple project to test Maven + Kotlin + Karate + GraalVM native images + Spring Boot against a database.

### Start the project

A `compose.yaml` file is provided to easier the developments. Another `PostgreSQL` instance can be used; in this
case the `application.yaml` may have to be updated.

```shell
docker compose up
```

This project is also configured with the `spring-boot-docker-compose` Spring dependency. The `docker-compose.yaml` can
be automatically launched using `spring.docker.compose.enabled` property.

#### Start the server

The server can be run using `maven`:

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Run the tests

The tests can be run using `maven`:

```shell
./mvnw clean test
```

### Run the integration tests

Integration tests can be run using the [Karate](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate) tool in
the [integration](./integration) directory. Download the [Karate](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/releases) `jar`
and run the following command to run the tests:

```shell
java -jar karate.jar integration
```

### Docker image build

A `local.compose.yaml` file is provided to easier the test using Docker images. For the moment, the Docker image
are not pushed and need to be locally built.

#### Build the image

```shell
docker build -t another-adventure:local .
```

#### Build the native image

```shell
./mvnw -Pnative -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=another-adventure:local spring-boot:build-image
```

#### Start the docker compose

```shell
docker compose -f local.compose.yaml up
```
